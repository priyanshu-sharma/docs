**2. Task:**

**3. Action:**

   - **Performance Evaluation**: I reviewed the individual’s performance and documented instances of underperformance and missed targets. I compared this with the support and resources provided to them and assessed whether there were any feasible solutions to improve the situation.
   - **Consulting HR**: I consulted with the HR department to ensure that the process was handled in accordance with company policies and legal requirements. This included discussing the appropriate steps and documentation required for termination.
   - **Preparing for the Conversation**: I prepared for the conversation by outlining the reasons for the termination in a clear and objective manner. I also prepared to offer support, such as providing a reference for future job opportunities.
   - **Conducting the Meeting**: I scheduled a private meeting with my friend to discuss the situation. I approached the conversation with empathy and respect, clearly explaining the reasons for the termination and how it was based on performance rather than personal issues. I offered support for their transition and discussed the next steps.

**4. Result:**
- **Outcome**: The termination was carried out professionally and in line with company policies. While the situation was difficult, my friend understood the reasons behind the decision and appreciated the support offered during the transition. I maintained a respectful and professional relationship with them after their departure.

### **Example of Setting Sights Too High:**

**1. Situation:**
- **Context**: While leading a project to implement a new data analytics platform at [Company Name], I set an ambitious goal to complete the entire implementation in half the typical timeframe, believing that our team’s capabilities and new technology would allow us to achieve this.

**2. Task:**
- **Objective**: My goal was to deliver the fully functional platform ahead of schedule to provide the business with early access to advanced analytics features.

**3. Action:**
- **Initial Approach**:
   - **Project Planning**: I developed a detailed project plan with an accelerated timeline, allocating resources and setting milestones based on the optimistic schedule.
   - **Team Coordination**: I communicated the ambitious goal to the team, emphasizing the potential benefits of an early delivery and motivating them to work towards the accelerated timeline.
   - **Monitoring Progress**: As the project progressed, I closely monitored the team’s workload and the challenges they encountered, adjusting the plan where necessary to address unforeseen issues.

**4. Result:**
- **Outcome**: Despite the team’s best efforts, the ambitious timeline proved too aggressive. We encountered unexpected technical challenges and required more time for thorough testing and quality assurance. As a result, the project was completed slightly behind the revised schedule, but still within a reasonable timeframe.
- **Impact**: The delay affected the planned rollout of the platform, but we were able to deliver a high-quality product with all necessary features. The experience highlighted the importance of setting realistic goals and allowing adequate time for thorough testing and quality assurance.

**5. Lessons Learned:**
- **Reflection**: This experience taught me the value of setting achievable goals based on realistic assessments of resources and potential challenges. It also reinforced the importance of building in buffer time for unexpected issues and maintaining flexibility in project planning.

### **Example Response:**

“In a project to implement a new data analytics platform, I set an ambitious goal to complete the implementation in half the typical timeframe, believing our team’s capabilities and new technology would make it possible.

I developed an accelerated project plan and motivated the team to meet the tight deadline. However, as the project progressed, it became clear that the timeline was too aggressive. We faced unexpected technical challenges and needed additional time for testing and quality assurance.
