Hello, and thank you for this opportunity to interview today. I'm Priyanshu Sharma, and I am excited to discuss the __ position. I have a deep passion for using data and technology to drive innovation and create value, and I believe my background in cloud engineering and big data makes me a strong fit for this role.

Currently, I am a Lead Big Data and Cloud Engineer at Truist Financial, where I've led the secure migration of data from on-premises data centers to AWS. My efforts have focused on optimizing data storage with solutions like AWS S3 and implementing scalable ETL processes using AWS Glue and Apache Airflow, resulting in significant improvements by 40% in data processing efficiency and cost savings for the organization. Prior to that, I was a Senior Data Engineer at Centene Corporation, where I managed large-scale data processing pipelines on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and integrated various Big Data tools like Apache Spark, Airflow, and Kafka to build a robust data architecture. These experiences have allowed me to lead cross-functional teams in designing, developing, and optimizing complex data workflows.

I am proficient with a range of tools and technologies, including AWS (S3, Redshift, EMR, Lambda), GCP (BigQuery, Cloud Composer), data engineering frameworks like Apache Spark and Airflow, and programming languages like SQL, Python, and Scala. I also have experience with Terraform for infrastructure automation, which I see as crucial for building and maintaining resilient data systems.

I’m particularly excited about the opportunity to leverage my skills and experience in a dynamic environment where data-driven decisions are central to the company's growth strategy. I’m eager to contribute my expertise to help drive impactful data solutions.

I'd love to know, from your perspective, what would be the biggest challenge in this role, and how can someone in this position make a difference right from day one?
