Based on your experience at Centene Corporation from August 2021 to September 2023, your data engineering pipeline likely involved a complex, large-scale system designed to handle diverse data types, sources, and workloads. Below is a detailed overview of your data engineering pipeline:

### 1. **Data Ingestion and Movement**
   - **Cloud Storage Transfer Service**: You used this service to securely and efficiently move data from on-premises systems to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), ensuring that both structured and unstructured data could be transferred at scale.
   - **Data Sources**: Data came from various sources, including Oracle databases, on-premise systems, and external platforms like Kafka. You utilized **Change Data Capture (CDC)** and batch processing techniques for real-time and scheduled data extraction.
   - **Storage Solutions**: Once ingested, data was stored in GCP storage solutions such as **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** for raw data, **Bigtable** for high-throughput NoSQL data, and **BigQuery** for analytical processing and querying.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
   - **Google Dataprep**: You used this service to clean, prepare, and transform the ingested data for further analysis. This involved tasks such as data validation, normalization, and error handling.
   - **Cloud Monitoring**: Throughout the preprocessing phase, **Cloud Monitoring** ensured that the data was tracked and any anomalies were flagged before moving it through the pipeline.

### 3. **Data Transformation**
   - **Apache Spark & PySpark**: For large-scale data transformations, you leveraged **Apache Spark** and **PySpark** on GCP, orchestrating transformations across distributed systems to handle complex computations and ensure scalability.
   - **DBT Integration**: You used **DBT** to manage transformations directly within the data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake), focusing on SQL-based transformation logic. This ensured seamless integration with your data warehouse solutions while maintaining proper version control and schema management.
   - **Scala-based ETL Pipelines**: For more complex transformations, you developed **Scala-based ETL pipelines**. These pipelines were optimized for large datasets and integrated with Big Data technologies such as **Hadoop**, **Hive**, and **Cassandra**.
   - **Apache Hive**: You also employed **Apache Hive** to create data models and schemas for batch processing and analytics queries, enabling interoperability with other Big Data frameworks like **Pig**, **Spark**, and **Kafka**.

### 4. **Data Storage and Management**
   - **BigQuery**: After transformation, structured data was stored in **BigQuery**, where you designed schemas and optimized tables for high-performance queries. You ensured proper indexing, partitioning, and clustering to improve data retrieval efficiency.
   - **Snowflake**: For other analytical workloads, you utilized **Snowflake**, creating well-structured schemas that support intricate querying. You also managed the integration of **Snowpipes** to automatically ingest data in near real-time from various sources.
   - **Google Cloud Storage & Pub/Sub**: You employed **GCS** for long-term data archiving and **Pub/Sub** for event-driven data streams, facilitating real-time ingestion and processing.

### 5. **Data Orchestration and Pipeline Management**
   - **Cloud Composer & Apache Airflow**: Your pipelines were orchestrated using **Cloud Composer** (a managed Apache Airflow service). This involved building Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that scheduled, monitored, and managed ETL jobs. You developed custom operators and sensors in Airflow to automate specific tasks within the pipeline.
   - **Vertex AI Pipelines**: You integrated **Vertex AI Pipelines** (formerly **Kubeflow Pipelines**) to manage machine learning workflows and deploy predictive models. The pipeline ensured that data flows seamlessly into machine learning models for training and inference.

### 6. **Data Processing and Analytics**
   - **Apache Spark (YARN)**: For distributed data processing, you used **Apache Spark** and **YARN** on **GCP DataProc**, which allowed you to process massive datasets in real-time or batch. This helped support advanced analytics, ML model training, and real-time decision-making.
   - **Real-time Processing**: You leveraged **Google Dataflow** and **PySpark ETL jobs** for real-time stream processing and analytics. This was particularly useful for scenarios requiring immediate data insights or ML model predictions.
   - **BI & Visualization Tools**: Transformed data was connected to tools like **Tableau** and **Looker** for visualization, enabling the creation of interactive dashboards and reports for stakeholders.

### 7. **Data Quality & Validation**
   - **Data Quality Checks**: As part of the transformation process, you established **data quality checks** to ensure that data accuracy, completeness, and reliability were maintained. This was critical to ensure that the data used for analytics, machine learning, and reporting was trustworthy.
   - **Validation Rules**: You applied validation rules within BigQuery and other storage layers to detect anomalies, missing data, or inconsistencies before further downstream processing.

### 8. **Infrastructure Provisioning and Management**
   - **Terraform**: You automated infrastructure provisioning and management using **Terraform**, ensuring that all cloud resources, including virtual machines, networks, and storage, were consistently and reproducibly configured across various environments.
   - **Kubernetes**: For containerized applications, you managed **Kubernetes** clusters to ensure scalability, load balancing, and high availability. This was crucial for running Spark jobs and deploying microservices in a distributed cloud environment.
   - **IAM Roles & Security**: You configured **IAM roles** to enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and services only had access to the necessary resources.

### 9. **Optimization and Cost Management**
   - **Resource Optimization**: You actively monitored and optimized GCP resources, leveraging **Cloud Billing** reports and recommendations to ensure cost-effective use of computing, storage, and networking services.
   - **Performance Tuning**: You enhanced the performance of ETL jobs and batch processing tasks by tuning Spark configurations and optimizing the use of cluster resources (e.g., memory, CPU allocation).

### 10. **Team Collaboration and Mentorship**
   - **Mentorship**: You mentored junior data engineers, sharing best practices in ETL, Snowflake schema design, and using tools like DBT and Airflow.
   - **Collaboration**: Throughout your tenure, you collaborated with data scientists, ML engineers, and business stakeholders to ensure that the pipeline served both analytical and operational needs.

### Conclusion
Your data engineering pipeline was robust, scalable, and optimized for handling massive datasets. It supported both batch and real-time data processing, integrated with cutting-edge machine learning workflows, and provided a reliable foundation for analytics and reporting across multiple GCP services and Big Data technologies.
