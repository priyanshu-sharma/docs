Scala is a modern, multi-paradigm programming language that integrates features of both **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **functional programming (FP)**. It runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, which means it is interoperable with Java and can use Java libraries and frameworks. Scala's concise syntax and powerful type system make it popular for applications in data engineering, distributed computing (e.g., Apache Spark), and general software development.

Here's an introduction to the basics of Scala:

### 1. Scala Basics: Syntax and Variables

- **Variable Declaration**: Scala has two types of variables:
  - **`val`**: Immutable (like `final` in Java). Once assigned, the value cannot be changed.
  - **`var`**: Mutable. The value can be reassigned.

   ```scala
   val immutableValue: Int = 42 // Immutable
   var mutableValue: Int = 10   // Mutable
   mutableValue = 20
   ```

   - Type inference is used, so you don’t always need to specify types explicitly:
     ```scala
     val name = "Scala" // Compiler infers the type as String
     ```

### 2. Functions

- Functions in Scala are **first-class citizens**. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned as values.

  ```scala
  def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
    a + b
  }

  // Usage
  val sum = add(3, 4) // sum is 7
  ```

- Functions can also be **anonymous** (lambda functions):

  ```scala
  val multiply = (x: Int, y: Int) => x * y
  println(multiply(2, 3)) // Output: 6
  ```

### 3. Control Structures

- **If/else**:
  
  ```scala
  val x = 10
  if (x > 0) println("Positive") else println("Negative")
  ```

- **Match (like switch in other languages)**:

  ```scala
  val day = "Monday"
  day match {
    case "Monday" => println("Start of the week")
    case "Friday" => println("End of the week")
    case _        => println("Middle of the week")
  }
  ```

- **For loops**:

  ```scala
  for (i <- 1 to 5) {
    println(i)
  }
  ```

- **While loops**:
  
  ```scala
  var i = 0
  while (i < 5) {
    println(i)
    i += 1
  }
  ```

### 4. Classes and Objects

- **Classes**: In Scala, a class defines the structure and behavior of an object.

  ```scala
  class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {
    def greet(): Unit = {
      println(s"Hello, my name is $name and I'm $age years old.")
    }
  }

  val person = new Person("Alice", 30)
  person.greet() // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 30 years old.
  ```

- **Objects**: An `object` in Scala is a **singleton**. It’s similar to a class but only one instance is created.

  ```scala
  object Singleton {
    def greet(): Unit = {
      println("Hello from singleton!")
    }
  }

  Singleton.greet() // Output: Hello from singleton!
  ```

- **Companion Object**: In Scala, a class and its companion object can be defined together. They share the same name and can access each other’s private members.

  ```scala
  class Companion(val name: String)
  
  object Companion {
    def printName(comp: Companion): Unit = {
      println(comp.name)
    }
  }

  val c = new Companion("CompanionExample")
  Companion.printName(c)
  ```

### 5. Case Classes

- **Case classes**: Used to define **immutable data structures** with built-in support for pattern matching, comparison, and copying.

  ```scala
  case class Book(title: String, author: String)

  val book1 = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
  val book2 = book1.copy(title = "Animal Farm") // Copy with modified field

  println(book1) // Output: Book(1984, George Orwell)
  println(book2) // Output: Book(Animal Farm, George Orwell)
  ```

### 6. Collections

Scala has a rich collection library, and collections are often immutable by default.

- **List** (Immutable):
  
  ```scala
  val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  println(numbers.map(_ * 2)) // Output: List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
  ```

- **Array** (Mutable):

  ```scala
  val arr = Array(1, 2, 3)
  arr(0) = 10
  println(arr.mkString(",")) // Output: 10,2,3
  ```

- **Set**:

  ```scala
  val set = Set(1, 2, 3)
  println(set.contains(2)) // Output: true
  ```

- **Map**:

  ```scala
  val map = Map("Alice" -> 25, "Bob" -> 30)
  println(map("Alice")) // Output: 25
  ```

### 7. Functional Programming in Scala

Scala encourages functional programming practices, like **higher-order functions**, **immutability**, and **pure functions**.

- **Higher-order functions**: Functions that take other functions as parameters or return them.
  
  ```scala
  val double = (x: Int) => x * 2
  val numbers = List(1, 2, 3)
  println(numbers.map(double)) // Output: List(2, 4, 6)
  ```

- **Pattern Matching**: Used to match values against patterns, similar to switch statements but more powerful.
  
  ```scala
  def matchNumber(x: Int): String = x match {
    case 1 => "One"
    case 2 => "Two"
    case _ => "Other"
  }
  ```

### 8. Traits

- **Traits**: Similar to interfaces in Java, but they can also contain concrete methods and fields.

  ```scala
  trait Animal {
    def sound(): String
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
    def sound(): String = "Bark"
  }

  val dog = new Dog
  println(dog.sound()) // Output: Bark
  ```

### 9. Option, Some, and None

- **Option**: A container for a value that may or may not be present.
  
  ```scala
  val someValue: Option[Int] = Some(10)
  val noValue: Option[Int] = None
  
  println(someValue.getOrElse(0)) // Output: 10
  println(noValue.getOrElse(0))   // Output: 0
  ```

### 10. Companion Object and Main Method

A common way to define a **main** method in Scala (like in Java) is within an object:

```scala
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, Scala!")
  }
}
```

### Conclusion

Scala provides a blend of object-oriented and functional programming features, making it a powerful language for both general-purpose programming and specialized applications like distributed computing with **Apache Spark**. It emphasizes immutability, concise syntax, and powerful type inference, making code more robust and maintainable.

Here’s a breakdown of the concepts you asked about: **pure function**, **currying**, the **difference between traits and sealed traits**, and the **difference between traits and interfaces**.

### 1. **Pure Function**
A **pure function** is a function that has the following two properties:
1. **Deterministic**: For the same input values, the function always returns the same output.
2. **No side effects**: A pure function doesn’t change the state of the system or interact with the outside world (e.g., by modifying variables, writing to files, or printing to the console).

#### Example of a Pure Function:
```scala
def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
  x + y
}
```
- For any given `x` and `y`, `add` will always return the same result.
- It doesn’t modify any external variables or perform any I/O operations.

#### Example of an Impure Function:
```scala
var counter = 0

def increment(): Int = {
  counter += 1
  counter
}
```
- This function is impure because it modifies the external `counter` variable, which is a side effect.

### 2. **Currying**
**Currying** is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. Instead of passing all arguments at once, you pass them one by one.

In Scala, currying is often used to partially apply a function, making it more flexible.

#### Example of a Curried Function:
```scala
def add(a: Int)(b: Int): Int = {
  a + b
}

// Using the curried function:
val add5 = add(5) _  // Partially applied function
println(add5(10))    // Output: 15
```
In this example, `add` is a curried function, and `add(5)` returns a new function that takes one argument and adds 5 to it.

### 3. **Difference Between Traits and Sealed Traits**

In Scala, both **traits** and **sealed traits** are used to define reusable code, but they differ in how they manage inheritance.

#### **Traits**:
- A **trait** is like an interface with concrete methods. It can be inherited by any class or other traits, allowing for multiple inheritance.
- It can be **extended** from anywhere in your program, even in separate files or modules.

```scala
trait Animal {
  def sound(): String
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  def sound(): String = "Bark"
}
```

#### **Sealed Traits**:
- A **sealed trait** is similar to a trait, but it restricts where the trait can be extended.
- When a trait is **sealed**, all the classes or objects that extend it must be declared in the same file.
- This is useful for **exhaustive pattern matching**. The compiler knows all the possible subclasses and can ensure that pattern matching is exhaustive.

```scala
sealed trait Animal

case class Dog() extends Animal
case class Cat() extends Animal
```

If you try to extend a sealed trait in a different file, the compiler will throw an error.

#### Main Difference:
- **Trait**: Can be extended from anywhere.
- **Sealed Trait**: Must be extended in the same file, ensuring all implementations are known at compile time (useful for pattern matching).

### 4. **Difference Between Traits and Interfaces**

In Scala, **traits** serve a similar purpose as **interfaces** in Java, but they offer more flexibility and features. Here’s a comparison:

#### **Traits**:
- **Multiple inheritance**: Traits support multiple inheritance. A class can extend multiple traits, allowing for more modular code.
- **Concrete methods**: Traits can have both **abstract** methods (methods without a body) and **concrete** methods (methods with a body).
- **Stateful**: Traits can have fields, both mutable and immutable, allowing them to hold state.
- **Can extend classes**: A trait can extend a class, while an interface in Java cannot.

```scala
trait Greet {
  def greet(): Unit = {
    println("Hello!")
  }
}

trait Name {
  def name(): String
}

class Person extends Greet with Name {
  def name(): String = "John"
}

val p = new Person
p.greet() // Output: Hello!
println(p.name()) // Output: John
```

#### **Interfaces (Java)**:
- **Single inheritance**: Java interfaces do not allow multiple inheritance (though Java 8 introduced default methods to simulate this behavior).
- **Abstract methods only (pre-Java 8)**: Before Java 8, interfaces could only have abstract methods. Java 8 introduced default methods, which allowed interfaces to have concrete methods.
- **Stateless**: Interfaces cannot have fields or hold state. They can only define methods that implementing classes must provide.
- **Cannot extend classes**: Interfaces cannot extend other classes, they can only extend other interfaces.

#### Main Differences:
- **Concrete methods**: Traits can have concrete methods, while Java interfaces (before Java 8) cannot.
- **Multiple inheritance**: Scala traits support multiple inheritance directly, whereas Java interfaces require workarounds (like default methods or abstract classes).
- **State**: Traits can contain variables and manage state, while Java interfaces cannot have state directly (though Java 8 introduced `static` and `default` methods with some limited stateful behavior).


The difference between **currying** and **partially applied functions** can be subtle but is important to understand, as they both involve breaking down the way functions handle arguments. Here's a breakdown of the two concepts:

### 1. **Currying**

Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument. In other words, instead of passing all arguments at once, a curried function takes the first argument and returns a new function that takes the next argument, and so on.

#### Example:
Here's a normal function that adds two integers:
```scala
def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
```

The curried version of this function looks like this:
```scala
def addCurried(x: Int)(y: Int): Int = x + y
```

When you call `addCurried(2)`, it returns a function that takes the second argument `y`:
```scala
val addTwo = addCurried(2)  // This returns a function that takes an Int and adds 2 to it.
println(addTwo(3))          // Output: 5
```

Key points about **currying**:
- It transforms a function with multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take one argument.
- Currying breaks down a function into nested functions.
- It allows partial application of functions (more on this below).

#### Curried Function Example:
```scala
def multiply(x: Int)(y: Int): Int = x * y

val multiplyBy2 = multiply(2) _   // Partially applies `x = 2`
println(multiplyBy2(3))           // Output: 6
```

### 2. **Partially Applied Functions**

A **partially applied function** is a function where you fix (or "apply") some of the arguments of the original function, producing a new function that takes fewer arguments. It doesn't require that the function be curried.

For a non-curried function, you can still "partially apply" its arguments. This means that some of the parameters are given concrete values, and a new function is returned, expecting the remaining parameters.

#### Example:
```scala
def add(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int): Int = x + y + z
```

You can create a **partially applied function** by providing only some of the arguments:
```scala
val addPartial = add(1, _: Int, _: Int)  // Partially apply the first argument (x = 1)
println(addPartial(2, 3))                // Output: 6
```

Key points about **partially applied functions**:
- You can apply some arguments to a function and "freeze" those arguments, creating a new function that takes the remaining arguments.
- Unlike currying, partial application can be done on functions that aren't curried.
- Partially applied functions don't transform the function into a series of nested functions but rather just "lock in" some arguments.

#### Partially Applied Function Example:
```scala
def greet(greeting: String, name: String): String = s"$greeting, $name!"

val sayHello = greet("Hello", _: String)  // Partially applies the first argument
println(sayHello("Priyanshu"))            // Output: Hello, Priyanshu!
```

### Summary of Differences:

| **Currying**                                        | **Partially Applied Functions**                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking one argument at a time. | Fixes (applies) some arguments of a function to create a new function with fewer arguments. |
| Always results in a function that takes one argument at a time. | The resulting function still takes multiple arguments, but fewer than the original. |
| Function signature changes to nested functions that take single arguments (e.g., `f(x)(y)(z)`). | Original function signature is unchanged, but some arguments are fixed. |
| Can be done manually using multiple parameter lists in Scala. | Can be applied to both curried and non-curried functions. |
| Example: `def add(x: Int)(y: Int) = x + y` | Example: `val partial = add(1, _: Int)` |

### Final Example Comparing Both:

#### Currying:
```scala
def curriedAdd(x: Int)(y: Int)(z: Int): Int = x + y + z

val add5 = curriedAdd(5) _     // Fix the first argument (x = 5)
val add5And3 = add5(3)         // Fix the second argument (y = 3)
println(add5And3(2))           // Output: 10 (5 + 3 + 2)
```

#### Partially Applied Function:
```scala
def normalAdd(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int): Int = x + y + z

val addPartial = normalAdd(5, _: Int, _: Int)  // Partially apply the first argument (x = 5)
println(addPartial(3, 2))                      // Output: 10 (5 + 3 + 2)
```
